Sunela Mechanical Design
========================

This repository contains the files for the mechanical design of prototypes for
the Sunela project. We use SolveSpace for 2D and 3D models and XFig for 2D
drawings.

The Sunela project is currently working towards a proof-of-concept prototype.
The designs here are therefore of limited use for anything beyond development
within this project.


Drawings and 3D models
----------------------

We currently have the following designs:

- display.slvs
  The reference 3D model of the P169H002 display module from Shenzhen P&O
  Technology Co., Limited, with a reconstruction of some of the model
  parameters.

  Note that display.slvs does not contain the original mesh and can therefore
  not be used as distributed. The original mesh be downloaded and converted by
  following the instructions in the section "Reference model for the display
  module"

- display.fig
  A 2D drawing summarizing the key parameters obtained from display.slvs, with
  some corrections based on the data sheet.

- frame.slvs
  A 3D model of a basic enclosure to hold the display module, based on the
  information in display.fig. The model was slightly adjusted based on
  mechanical testing and to provide room for an additional FPC not shown in the
  reference material.

- pcb.slvs
  A 2D model, based on information in display.fig and frame.slvs, for the PCB
  and possible battery options.

- stacking.fig
  Vertical stacking (draft)


Reference model for the display module
--------------------------------------

We obtain the reference geometry from two sources, both available from Sipeed:

1) the drawings in the data sheet (P169H002-CTP.pdf)
2) CAD-generated mesh (1.69inch.step)

To obtain these files, first download 169H002-CTP.rar from
https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/6_Chip_Manual/touch_screen

Unpack the archive with
unrar x P169H002-CTP.rar 

The data sheet is in P169H002-CTP.pdf, with the mechanical drawings on page 9.

The 3D mesh is in the archive 1.69inch 电容触摸屏资料.rar
Extract it with
unrar x 1.69inch*.rar 1.69inch.step

We use SolveSpace, which can import STL but not STEP. To convert from STEP to
STL, we can use FreeCAD:

freecad 1.69inch.step
